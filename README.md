# VetoDB Docs

**Note that we're working on another module that fixes security and performance issues.**

VetoDB is an open sourced SQLite3 wrapper for nodejs. Great for developers needing basic storage requiring the power of SQL, but feel intimidated by the language. VetoDB has some great core features while remaining lightweight.

- Persistent Storage - Data doesn't disappear
- Beginner Friendly - Created for beginners learning about data storage, documentation is straightforward.
- Querying - VetoDB allows basic queries, like matching certain values in columns,

# Installation

You can install VetoDB using npm.
```
npm install vetodb sqlite3 -g
```

# Info
I'm still working on this. There's definite security issues (like a lack of data sanitization) so use at your own risk. Documentation coming soon!
